# ACCU 2018 PDFs

This repository contains all the PDFs offered for inclusion on the [ACCU Conference
website](https://conference.accu.org) website associated with teh ACCU 2018 conference.

After each ACCU conference, PDFs are collected to be associated with the videos on the [ACCU Conference channel on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw/), and linked to from the schedule pages of
the ACCU website.

This repository is separate from the website repository to avoid the problems of that repository getting
huge and unwieldy due to these "blobs".

## Naming Strategy

This repository uses a PDF file naming strategy _presenter-name_\_-\__session-title_.pdf avoiding all spaces by replacing
spaces with underscores. For many presenter sessions list all presenters separated with double
underscore. So for example:

only\_presenter\_name\_-\_title\_of\_the\_session.pdf

presenter\_one\_name\_\_presenter\_two\_name\_-\_title\_of\_this\_two\_person\_session.pdf
